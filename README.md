# CityMe Laravel API

## The project

The CityMe project aims at creating a framework for mapping, exploring and analyzing official and non-official neighborhoods, regions of interest, districts and other areas that constitute peopleâ€™s mental map of the city. By harvesting data from our map-based application and social media platforms, we can better understand how citizens spatially reason about administrative and non-administrative regions in the urban landscape, such as parishes, residential areas, informal neighborhoods, historical centers and commercial areas.
